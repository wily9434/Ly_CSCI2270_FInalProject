# Ly_CSCI2270_FinalProject

#Project Summary
This is the my final project for CSCI 2270.
I used codeblocks to write my function. 
Download the files: main.cpp,  myShop.cpp, myShop.h, playerItems.txt, shopItems.txt.
Then put main.cpp, myShop.cpp, myShop.h into a project and run.
Make sure that the two .txt files are in the same folder as the other three files, otherwise it wont run correctly.
What was use a binary search tree and made it into a video game shop.
In some ways it is like assignment 7 with the movie rental.
The main difference is that you can buy items without removing a node from the shop.
Also you can sell items to the shop as well.

#How to Run
When you run the code, a menu should show up.

1. Print shop inventory 

2. Print player inventory 

3. Buy item 

4. Sell item  

5. item Description 

6. Quit


Enter a number, (1) and hit the enter button on your keyboard. To sell something, simply press (3), and type in the item you want to sell. ie Noob Sword.

(I do recomend that you print out player's inventory to see what items you have to sell.)

In order to buy an item is a little more complicated, you have to type in the item's name, attribute, cost, and quantity.

(I recomend to first print out the Shop's inventory, find an item you want to buy, then hit (5) and get the item description of that item.)

For example, type in 1 at the main menu, and a list should pop up.

1.Noob Sword x 1

2.Noob Helmet x 3

3.Cool Helmet x 3 (The (x integar) just means the quantity of that item the store has.)



Then, after printing out the list put in (5) and type in the item you want to describe.

For example, hit (5) at the main menu.

Enter item name for description:

Cool Helmet



Item Description

Item: Cool Helmet

Attribute: + 15

Cost: 30 gp

Quantity: 3


Then at the main menu type in (3) to buy the item and type in the description like this.

Cool Helmet, 15, 30, 1

Tadaa! You have bought a Cool Helmet!
